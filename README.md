### PDF Question-Answering System Using LLMs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a question-answering system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and respond to queries based on content from PDF documents. Given hardware limitations, the models are selected for efficiency while maintaining high performance in tasks requiring reasoning and truthfulness. Additionally, the system integrates an optimized approach for embedding sentence-level meaning and processing large documents in real-time. The result is a fast and accurate document-based question-answering system.
